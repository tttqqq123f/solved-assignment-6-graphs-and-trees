<em>Write pseudo-code not Java for problems requiring code. You are responsible for the appropriate level of detail. For the questions asking for justification, please provide a detailed mathematically oriented discussion. A proof is not required.</em>

<ol>

 <li>How many ancestors does a node at level n in a binary tree have? Provide justification.</li>

 <li>Prove that a strictly binary tree (regular binary tree) with n leaves contains 2n-1 nodes. Provide justification.</li>

 <li>Explain in detail that if m pointer fields are set aside in each node of a general m-ary tree to point to a maximum of m child nodes, and if the number of nodes in the tree is n, the number of null child pointer fields is n*(m-1)+1.</li>

 <li>Implement maketree, setleft, and setright for right in-threaded binary trees using the sequential array representation.</li>

 <li>Implement inorder traversal for the right in-thread tree in the previous problem.</li>

 <li>Define the Fibonacci binary tree of order n as follows: If n=0 or n=1, the tree consists of a single node. If n&gt;1, the tree consists of a root, with the Fibonacci tree of order n-1 as the left subtree and the Fibonacci tree of order n-2 as the right subtree. Write a method that builds a</li>

</ol>

Fibonacci binary tree of order n and returns a pointer to it.

<ol start="7">

 <li>Answer the following questions about Fibonacci binary tree defined in the previous problem.

  <ol>

   <li>Is such a tree strictly binary?</li>

   <li>What is the number of leaves in the Fibonacci tree of order n?</li>

   <li>What is the depth of the Fibonacci tree of order n?</li>
